1. **Which borough in New York has the highest number of shootings?**
2. **Which race has been shot the most?**

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

# data set GitHub url
ghub_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fayliette/MSDS_R/main/NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Historic_.csv"

# Load data set 
df <- read.csv(ghub_url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Display the first 6 rows of the data set
head(df)

# Get the  overview of the data set
summary(df)

# Get the total shootings in each borough
boro_shootings <- table(df$BORO)
boro_shootings 
# bar graph of the shootings in each borough
ggplot(data = as.data.frame(df), aes(x = BORO)) + geom_bar() +  xlab("BOROUGHS") +
  ylab("SHOOTINGS") +
  ggtitle("NYC SHOOTINGS")

# Get the total number of times each race has been shot
vic_race <- table(df$VIC_RACE)
vic_race
# Display the mean and median of the latitude and longitude
summarize(df, mean_lat = mean(Latitude, na.rm=TRUE), median_lat = median(Latitude, na.rm=TRUE),
          mean_long = mean(Longitude, na.rm=TRUE), median_long = median(Longitude, na.rm=TRUE))

# Create a copy of the  data frame and replace all the empty values in the PERP_SEX column to "U" for unknown 
# and the empty values in the PERP_RACE column to "UNKNOWN" in the new data frame
new_df <- df
new_df["PERP_SEX"][new_df["PERP_SEX"] == ""] <- "U"
new_df["PERP_RACE"][new_df["PERP_RACE"] == ""] <- "UNKNOWN"
head(new_df)

# Create a Subset with the BORO, PERP_SEX, PERP_RACE, VIC_SEX, AND VIC_RACE from the borough Brooklyn
#subset(education, Region == 2, select = c("State","Minor.Population","Education.Expenditures"))
brklyn_df <- subset(new_df, BORO == "BROOKLYN", select = c("BORO", "PERP_SEX", "PERP_RACE", "VIC_SEX", "VIC_RACE"))
head(brklyn_df)

```
**Based on my analysis, There has been more shootings in Brooklyn than any other borough in NYC. Of all the shootings in NYC most of the victims were part of the black race. This information can be used when the NYC government and authorities are looking for ways to decrease shootings in the Boroughs. More attention and resources need to be applied to Brooklyn to help decrease the rate of shootings in the city.**
